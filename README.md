# Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.
#Project Overview

This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

#Running the program
 
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.
